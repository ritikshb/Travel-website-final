        <p style="margin-top:5px;">Famously known as ‘Heaven on Earth’, Srinagar is located in the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir, on the banks of river Jhelum. As picturesque as the most stunning painting to ever be painted, Srinagar is known
          for the stationary houseboats and colourful Shikararas on Dal Lake.

          The main draw of Sringara, the gondola-type rowboats - Shikaras are used by the tourists to see attractions like the Floating Vegetable Market, and the Mir Bahris – a lively community of people who live on the lake itself. Known as the
          summer capital of Jammu & Kashmir, Srinagar is home to some of the
          most exquisite Mughal-age gardens in India, with the top attractions being Nishat Bagh, Shalimar Bagh and Chashm-E-Shahi Garden.
          Amarnath is one of the most important pilgrimage in India for the worshippers of Lord Shiva. The Amarnath cave is haven to an enshrined image of ice called the Shivaling formed naturally, which resembles Lord Shiva.

        <p style="margin-top:5px;">
          Amarnath is visited by millions of tourists every year from all across the world in what is famously known as the 'Amarnath Yatra'. The Amarnath cave situated in this town is considered to be a devout location for the pilgrims, most notably
          Hindus. Legend has it that, this place is regarded to be the
          same cave where Lord Shiva revealed the secret of life and eternity to Goddess Parvati.</p>

        Jammu is the southernmost-part of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir which sits proudly on the magnificent Shivalik mountain ranges. The Winter Capital of Kashmir, Jammu is a holy and peaceful city known for its majestic temples,
        religious shrines, glittering "shikhars", and cultural heritage. Since it is also the starting point to the hugely popular Vaishno Devi Temple and Amarnath Yatra, it is visited by tourists from far and wide.
        Nestled against the backdrop of the snow-capped Pir Panjal Mountains, Jammu forms part of the transition between the Himalayan range in the north and the dusty plains of Punjab in the south. The Shivalik hills cut across the area from the
        east to the west while the rivers Ravi, Tawi and Chenab cut their way through the region.


        Sonamarg is a picturesque hill station in Jammu and Kashmir, located 80km north-east of Srinagar. At an elevation of around 2800 km from sea level, Sonamarg is known for its snow-laden fields, surrounded by majestic glaciers and serene lakes
        which casts subtle spells on the travellers.
        Sonamarg is enveloped by the great Himalayan glaciers - Kolhoi Glacier and Machoi Glacier - and gives rise to the famous Three Sisters of Kashmir Valley. Towering over this charming hill town are the peaks like Kolhoi Peak, Amarnath Peak,
        Machoi Peak and Sirbal Peak which makes Songamarg a popular place for adventure sports tourism.

        Located in Trikuta hills, 13 kms from Katra (in Jammu and Kashmir); Vaishno Devi is a town that's home to the famous Vaishno Devi Mandir. This renowned shrine allures millions of devotees from all over the world. Popularly known as Mata Rani,
        Vaishnavi and Trikuta, Vaishno Devi is a manifestation of the Hindu Goddess Durga. It isbelieved that during the pooja and aarti, Goddesses arrive at the Holy cave to pay their respect to Mata Rani. Devotees believe goddess herself calls the
        devotees to reach here.
        Vaishno Devi is a religious trekking destination which is managed by the Holy shrine board incepted in 1986. To reach the mandir, pilgrims walk about 13km uphill to reach the caves which are among one of the 108 Shakti Peetha. It takes about
        6-9 hours depending on the weather and pace. Ponies and Palanquins, as well as helicopter
        services, are available by various vendors to take you up there. The whole way is decently paved with lots of shops selling snacks, food and religious goods. More than one crore devotees visit Vaishno Devi temple each year. With endless
        meadows and panoramic views of the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, Patnitop is a perfect place to experience nature at its picturesque best and widest. Also spelt Patni Top, it is a famous hill station in the Udhampur district of Jammu &
